// Task 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
// A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days days.
// The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i]. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
// Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within days days.

// Algo: binary Search
// perform it on every weight given to check if passes

const daysNeeded = (weights, capacity): number => {
    // start with 0 bc we have not loaded anything on our ship yet

        currentShipWeight += weight
        
        // if our weight exceeds our capacity we need
        // to come back another day. So, add a day &
        // reset our current ship weight to the current weight
        // so it is included in the next day's shipment
